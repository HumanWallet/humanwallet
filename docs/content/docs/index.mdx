# Welcome to HumanWallet

HumanWallet is a comprehensive Web3 wallet solution that combines **WebAuthn passkey authentication** with **account abstraction (ERC-4337)** to deliver a seamless, secure, and user-friendly blockchain experience.

## What Makes HumanWallet Different?

Traditional Web3 wallets require users to manage complex seed phrases and private keys, creating significant barriers to adoption. HumanWallet eliminates these pain points by leveraging modern authentication standards and smart contract technology.

## Key Features

### 🆔 No Seed Phrases
Users authenticate with their device's built-in biometrics instead of managing complex private keys. This eliminates the risk of lost or stolen seed phrases while maintaining security through hardware-backed authentication.

### ⛽ Gasless Transactions
Optional gas sponsorship through configurable paymasters means users can interact with dApps without needing to hold native tokens for transaction fees.

### 📱 Mobile-First Design
Works seamlessly on mobile devices without requiring app installation. Users can access their wallet through any web browser using their device's native authentication.

### 🔒 Enhanced Security
- **Hardware Security**: Private keys stored in secure device enclaves
- **WebAuthn Standard**: Uses W3C WebAuthn specification for secure authentication
- **EIP-6492**: Smart contract signature verification standard
- **Audited Dependencies**: Built on audited ZeroDev and Viem foundations

## How It Works

    C --> D[Smart Contract Wallet]
    D --> E[Paymaster Sponsorship]
    E --> F[Transaction Execution]
    F --> G[On-chain Confirmation]
```

1. **Authentication**: User authenticates using device biometrics (FaceID/TouchID)
2. **Smart Wallet**: Transaction is processed through a smart contract wallet
3. **Gas Sponsorship**: Optional paymaster covers transaction fees
4. **Execution**: Transaction is bundled and executed on-chain

## Quick Start

Get started with HumanWallet in just a few steps:

### Installation

```bash
npm install @humanwallet/connector viem wagmi
```

### Basic Integration

```typescript
import { humanWalletConnector } from '@humanwallet/connector'
import { createConfig } from 'wagmi'
import { mainnet, polygon } from 'wagmi/chains'

const connector = humanWalletConnector({
  projectId: 'your-zerodev-project-id',
  appName: 'My DApp',
  dappMetadata: {
    name: 'My DApp',
    url: 'https://mydapp.com',
    iconUrl: 'https://mydapp.com/icon.png'
  }
})

const config = createConfig({
  chains: [mainnet, polygon],
  connectors: [connector]
})
```

### React Usage

```tsx
import { useConnect, useAccount } from 'wagmi'

function ConnectWallet() {
  const { connect, connectors } = useConnect()
  const { address } = useAccount()

  const humanWallet = connectors.find(c => c.id === 'humanWallet')

  if (address) {
    return <div>Connected: {address}</div>
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={() => connect({ connector: humanWallet })}>
      Connect with HumanWallet
    </button>
  )
}
```
